# Introduction

Hey! :) It's an exercice for NodeJS App named "Customer Management". 
As the name, we are to build an application for managing Customers/Clients. 

These are the features :
* Project: For any project, depends on the user.
* Collection/Categories: Including all type of categories or collection that they have. 
* Products: Products to be managed (Orders, Delivering, Payment, ...)

I'm open for any suggestions.

Enjoy for your contribution.

Bye! ;)
